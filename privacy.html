        <h2>PR1V4CY</h2>
        <p>Nothing to hide (NTH) is a privacy infrastructure provider based in The Netherlands. We operate privacy-enhancing services world wide and on this page you can read all about how we process your personal identifiable information (PII) for these services. If you have any questions about the processing of PII, please <a href="https://nothingtohide.nl/contact">contact</a> us.</p>
        <p>Our public services are built in accordance with current privacy design strategies and best practices in mind. In short this means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We limit, separate, abstract and hide (the processing of) PII as much as possible.</li>
                <li>We're transparent about the processing of PII to our data subjects.</li>
                <li>We will never sell PII to third-parties.</li>
                <li>We won't share PII with third-parties unless it's one of our data processors (like Tuta GmbH for handling our email) or unless we are compelled to do so by a competent authority.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Websites</h3>

        <h3>Tor relays</h3>
        <p>When you use one of our Tor relays, your traffic will be routed through our infrastructure. This includes both the (heavily encrypted) contents and the traffic metadata such as the IP address. Do note that Nothing to hide can't view the contents of the traffic since it's heavily encrypted by the Tor network. In addition we don't log anything regarding the Tor relays or Tor traffic so although we process such information on a realtime basis, we can't view it.</p>
