        <h2>Transparency Report December 2022</h2>
        <p>Nothing to hide became a Tor exit relay operator this month, in addition to running only guard/middle relays before. This is a good time to start with monthly transparency reports and so here it is.</p>

        <p>DNS requests on the Tor network are resolved by the Tor exit relays. This means that high capacity Tor exit relays such as ours generate a *lot* of DNS queries. These queries are being resolved by multiple high capacity DNS resolvers in the same network.</p>
        <p>This is the first month for our Tor exit relays so the total amount of DNS queries and queries per second are still pretty modest. We expect these numbers to rise considerable during the ramp-up phase of the Tor exit relays.</p>

        <p>Do note that we don't log the contents of DNS queries and can't provide further insight in to DNS traffic.</p>

        <h4>2.3 Tor diversity</h4>
        <p>One of our goals is to break the GNU/Linux monoculture currently present on the Tor network. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially disastrous.</p>
        <p>We make the Tor network stronger by running all our relays on FreeBSD. Here we report on our ongoing effort to increase operating system diversity on the Tor network.</p>
        <!-- tor diversity statistics -->
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Period</th>
                <th>NTH Guard</th>
                <th>BSD Guard</th>
                <th>GNU Guard</th>
                <th>NTH Exit</th>

                <th>GNU Exit</th>

                <td>0.0%</td>
                <td>0.9%</td>
                <td>99.1%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>December 2022</td>
                <td>0.12%</td>
                <td>7.1%</td>
                <td>92.9%</td>
                <td>3.63%</td>
                <td>5.1%</td>
                <td>94.9%</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>In december we more than quadrupled *BSD's share of exit relay traffic, but that's hardly an achievement considering the abysmal state of *BSD usage on the Tor network before. It's a nice start though and we will continue our efforts in 2023.</p>

        <h4>2.4 DDoS attacks</h4>
        This month five all-out DDoS attacks were endured on our guard/middle relays. During these attacks the bandwidth contribution to the Tor network was reduced by ~2.5 Gb/s.
