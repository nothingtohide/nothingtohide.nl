        <h2>Transparency Report January 2023</h2>
        <p>This month's efforts resulted in achieving some nice milestones. We became the biggest Tor relay provider in terms of both bandwidth and exit probability and broke the threshold of 10% BSD share, making GNU/Linux less of an monoculture. In addition the first steps towards a capable DNS infrastructure to manage the growing amount of DNS queries have been taken.</p>
        <p>The metrics used in this report are rounded extrapolated snapshots of the final day of the month, to not give away too much specific information.</p>

        <h3>1 Requests & orders</h3>
        We did not receive any official or unofficial requests or orders this month.

        <p>DNS requests on the Tor network are resolved by the Tor exit relays. This means that high capacity Tor exit relays can generate a *lot* of DNS queries. These queries are being resolved by multiple high capacity DNS resolvers.</p>
        <p>The queries-per-second rate more than doubled this month, which added a considerable additional load on our DNS resolvers. We added one more DNS resolver to cope with the increase in queries and account for failover scenarios, where one or two DNS resolvers can become inaccessible at any time without disrupting our Tor service. In addition we added DNS-over-TLS to our externally hosted DNS resolvers, to make it significantly harder for adversaries to intercept and/or manipulate DNS query content.</p>

        <h4>2.3 Tor diversity</h4>
        <p>One of our major goals is to break the GNU/Linux monoculture currently present on the Tor network. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. In a globally used anonymity network, monocultures can be disastrous.</p>
        <p>We make the Tor network stronger by running all our relays on FreeBSD. Here we report on our ongoing effort to increase operating system diversity on the Tor network.</p>

        <p>In January the BSD Consensus Weight share of exit relay traffic hit the milestone of 10%. While this share is still in stark contrast with GNU/Linux's 90%, you could say the Tor network is no longer a GNU/Linux monoculture. Sadly with the current size of the Tor network Nothing to hide can't contribute much more in terms of BSD share, since that would result in centralisation issues.</p>
        <p>High capacity guard relays on the other hand are more difficult to run than ever before. The ongoing DDoS attacks make it difficult to get and maintain guard status, so this month we sadly didn't contribute to a increase in BSD Consensus Weight share of guard relays. We have to look in to effective DDoS countermeasures.</p>

        <h4>2.4 DDoS attacks</h4>
        <p>This month there was pretty much one big permanent DDoS attack (with the occasional break of a few hours) endured on our guard/middle relays. This resulted in a significant reduction to our bandwidth contribution to the Tor network and made sure the middle relays couldn't become guard relays this month as well.</p>
        <p>The adversaries' primary goal still seems to prevent the middle relays from becoming guard relays, which proves to be successful for now. In February and March we will look in to countermeasures to thwart the adversaries' efforts more effectively.</p>
